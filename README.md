# photo-circle-rating

This is one of my hobby projects which goal is practicing new technologies like Vue.js and Firebase.
This application is actively used by many Hungarian photographers from different photo groups/circles to challege each other, rate each others' photos and such.
Obviously, there are a lot of things that could have been done way better, more professionally but hey, it's just a hobby project! :)
